Virtual Simulated Clinician (VSC) – DSM-Integrated Documentation Engine Upgrade Overview This release of the Virtual Simulated Clinician (VSC) platform integrates DSM-5-TR specifier-driven diagnostic narratives directly into the automated documentation engine. The build links diagnostic category selections to dynamic assessment generation, targeted intervention recommendations, and risk flagging logic — while preserving full homework library access.

This version also incorporates the Biometric Concordance trigger for high-risk intervention pathways. For example, when a DSM selection matches a Borderline Personality Disorder specifier and the biometric concordance reading is “Low,” the system invokes an adaptive high-risk response loop to insert additional clinical risk management content into the note.

What’s New in This Release DSM-Driven Narrative Injection – All DSM specifiers in the drop-down menu now feed directly into the session summary and Assessment section of the generated DAP note.

Biometric Concordance-Linked Escalation – Replaces the old Borderline Personality Disorder toggle button with a conditional trigger based on biometric concordance + DSM match.

Preserved Homework Library – Full set of 50 PDF-based homework assignments remains accessible from the interface.

Framework Retention – All original therapeutic framework options (CBT, DBT, MI, SFBT, etc.) remain operational and selectable alongside the DSM category list.

Intellectual Property & Build Narrative
Intellectual Property Disclaimer
This build and all associated code, logic structures, algorithms, and user interface elements are proprietary to the inventor. Any replication, modification, or redistribution of the underlying algorithms, logic flows, or generated outputs without explicit written permission from the inventor constitutes a violation of intellectual property rights. This system is part of an ongoing patent-protected invention designed to create a real-time interactive documentation engine for clinical simulation and is protected under applicable intellectual property laws.

Build Narrative
This build represents an evolution from the published Option B Hotfix build deployed last night. Option B contained the working Borderline Personality Disorder (BPIRL) trigger — selecting Low Concordance in real time activated BPIRL mode, which injected DSM descriptors and treatment goals directly into the session dialogue and DAP note. Each additional DSM specifier selected appended more diagnosis codes to the dialogue, building a complete diagnostic record in real time without manual typing.

The goal of the invention is to automate documentation so that everything captured during a simulated session — dialogue, DSM specifiers, treatment goals, and additional scenario elements — is recorded into a complete DAP note ready for export. Losing this real-time documentation feature would undermine the core purpose of the invention, which is why it was restored and preserved here.

In addition to restoring the Option B BPIRL behavior, this build adds:

A Clinician Tendencies dropdown menu for selecting personality/interaction style.
Projection-ready algorithms for integrating Tier 10 logic items and supporting projection-based clinician display (e.g., desktop projector output).
"Stash for Later" functionality for capturing and storing session elements for deferred integration or review.
The result is a fully functional build that preserves the real-time documentation behavior from Option B while introducing new features that expand platform capability. Simulated Clinician Reflex Loop (SCRL)
