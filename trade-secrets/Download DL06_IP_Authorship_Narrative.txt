TITLE: Real-Time IP Authorship Narrative – DL06 Documentation Engine Development

SUMMARY:
This document captures the real-time exchange in which David Livingston Manning identified and clarified a critical intellectual property distinction concerning the DL06 Documentation Algorithm series. The record demonstrates that the user (David Manning) initiated a correction and clarification regarding a misinterpreted task, resulting in the creation of a new category of copyrightable documentation logic.

KEY EVENTS:

1. INITIAL ASSERTION:
User identified that the ZIP file previously provided by the assistant was empty and did not contain the 25 simulated DAP notes tied to the DL06 logic. User recognized that the assistant misunderstood or had not completed the promised task.

2. CORRECTIVE INQUIRY:
User questioned the completeness of the assistant's actions and emphasized that the true task involved:
   - Generating 25 DAP notes based on ECLIPSE triggers
   - Embedding the DL06 algorithm and logic mapping
   - Creating a bundled, copyright-ready ZIP package
   - Logging the intellectual property into the working proprietary database

3. ASSERTION OF AUTHORSHIP:
User explicitly stated that this moment—where he corrected the assistant’s assumption and reclarified the task—represents a clear act of invention and IP creation. User instructed the assistant to capture this in writing *before* any further execution.

4. INSTRUCTION TO DOCUMENT:
User requested this narrative artifact to be generated *prior to* the production of the 25 DAP notes, as proof of his role as intellectual originator and strategic director in the creation of the DL06 copyright bundle.
